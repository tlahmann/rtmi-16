\section{Conclusion}
\textbf{Virtual reality games can and will undergo a lot of changes, especially with the general development of VR in the near future. It will, however, take time, money, and a combined effort on the part of many people.}

VR and HMD are not yet core technologies in todays gaming society but I am being confident that this will change rapidly and the advantages will quickly adapt to many areas of our every day life, as well as gaming.
