\section{Conclusion}
\textbf{Virtual reality games can and will undergo a lot of changes, especially with the general development of VR in the near future. It will, however, take time, money, and a combined effort on the part of many people.}

VR and HMD are not yet core technologies in todays gaming society but I am being confident that this will change rapidly and the advantages will quickly adapt to many areas of our every day life, as well as gaming.

Almost all of the senses of the human body can be reached with todays technology. Some people may like the thought of totally immersed gaming, other find it disturbing.\newline
Although a controversy appears in some fields the research will surely go on in the next years bringing many innovative and tense devices to our lives including better interaction, conclusive visual effects, stunning audio and astonishing touchable illusions. 

There are just many ways of finding new ways to improve VR gaming in the future. VR is on the edge of becoming a main way to experience games and the enormous potential offers just too many aspects to consider in one paper.
