\section{Discussion}
Although many points have been outline in the previous sections it is important to notice that many of them have just been general suggestions on what topics have to be researched in virtual reality especially to provide effective game developers the opportunity to make great VR games. 

It also remains that some aspects, as said before, have just a little interest in gaming industry as well as the research institutes. I am thinking of \textit{Smell} and \textit{taste} aspects. 
These subjects remain interesting for very few use cases and i cannot think of many applications where it will be needed in the near future. 
I am still certain that the development will still go along with these senses as well. It is considered a main goal of all efforts to gain the perfect illusion after all.

I wanted to show the many aspects of VR gaming and the research that has to be done in order to improve VR gaming. After all illustration the evaluation of these remains to be done by professional researchers in their specific field of studies, but the main goal of this publication has been reached.
